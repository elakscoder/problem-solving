/*Oops problem 1 
Write a program to manage organisation, employee data  like name, employee id, age, position. I should be able to credit salary to any employee and should able to see total salary given to an employee.
 Organisation will have an account with fixed amount, employee salary should be debited from that organisation account. Throw error if insufficient amount
 Should be able to get organisationâ€™s balance amount and total amount spend for employee salaries*/
